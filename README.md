### Usage:

In network/ folder you can run files in terminal **(Mac)** by writing

```sh [name of the file]```

Example:

```sh 01```

###### Network commands were made on Mac OS. I'm not sure of their usage on other OS.
###### Scripts and system commands were written in Debian 9.4 virtual machine. You can clone them and use just like Network commands.
